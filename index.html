<h1 class="roof">The Cambridge Lovelace Hackathon 2015</h1>

<p>
December 2015 sees the 200th anniversary of the birth of Ada Lovelace,
the mathematician and writer.
She saw in computers, and particularly the amazing
Analytical Engine, possibilities far beyond the arithmetic
manipulation of numbers.
In order to celebrate this vision
and her remarkable life, we're holding a hackathon in Cambridge, UK in
December.
