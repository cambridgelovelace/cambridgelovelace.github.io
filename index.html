<h1 class="roof">The Cambridge Ada Lovelace Hackathon 2015</h1>

<p>
December 2015 sees the 200th anniversary of the birth of Ada Lovelace,
the mathematician and writer, and self-identified &lsquo;analyst (&amp;
metaphysician)&rsquo;. She saw in computers, and particularly the amazing
Analytical Engine, possibilities far beyond the arithmetic
manipulation of numbers.
In order to celebrate this vision
and her remarkable life, we're holding a hackathon in Cambridge, UK in
December.
