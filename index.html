<h1 class="roof">The Cambridge Lovelace Hackathon 2015</h1>

<p>
This year sees the 200th anniversary of the birth of Ada Lovelace,
the mathematician and writer.
She saw in computers, and particularly the amazing
Analytical Engine, possibilities far beyond the arithmetic
manipulation of numbers.
In order to celebrate this vision
and her remarkable life, we're holding a hackathon.
</p>

<p class="highlight">
The main session will take place between 1pm and 7pm on Thursday, 10th 
December 2015 in room MR3 at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at
the University of Cambridge.
</p>

<p>
MR3 can be found in the basement of Pavilion A, near the
foot of the stairs leading from the Reception. Disabled access is via a lift
in Pavilion D. CMS provides a
<a href="http://www.cms.cam.ac.uk/plan/meetingrooms.html">map of the meeting rooms</a> as well as 
<a href="http://www.cms.cam.ac.uk/visiting/">useful information
about finding the centre</a>. The Centre has a caf&eacute; which will be
open until 4pm, and their website
<a href="http://www.cms.cam.ac.uk/catering/">suggests other options for food</a>.

<h2>What's happening</h2>

<p>
We expect to hold sessions during the lead-up to the main event, in which 
we get together to form teams, develop ideas, program and test, or to
play games, drink tea, and socialise. The main event will include interesting
talks relating to Lovelace's work, to mathematics in general, and will
conclude with each team presenting their work, if they want to.
In the spirit of a hackathon, everybody should try to come along with their
own ideas and projects on the day, based on their individual interests and
skills.
</p>

<p>
We will use this website to publicise the hackathon projects as they form,
with details of who to team up with if you're interested,
in the hope that it'll help those
proposing projects find those who want to contribute to them.
We also invite people to create respositories for their project in our
<a href="https://github.com/cambridgelovelace">GitHub organisation</a>,
in order to keep everything in one place.
</p>

<p>
The following projects and activities have been proposed already:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Working towards building the Analytical Engine</dt>
<dd>
This project would aim to contribute in some concrete way to
<a href="http://plan28.org/">the Plan 28
project</a>. The best outcome would be something that helps the machine get
built, whether it's annotating documents, coding up simulations, working
out how certain bits worked, or modelling the mechanical operations of the
Engine.
<br/>The contact for this project is
<a href="http://www.sq3.org.uk/wiki.pl">Tim Hutton</a>.
</dd>
<dt>Seminars and discussion groups</dt>
<dd>We are welcoming those who would like to give seminars or hold discussion
groups
on the contributions of women in STEM, on computation, on the 
applications that Lovelace saw for computers, or historical talks on Lovelace
herself, or any other related topic.
These can be informal or more formal, an hour long or a lightening
talk.
<br/>Sessions will be coordinated by 
<a href="https://cp4space.wordpress.com/author/apgoucher/">Adam P. Goucher</a>.
</dd>
<dt>Programming the Analytical Engine</dt>
<dd>
We could produce
programs of mathematical problems for the machine to run, or test some of
Ada's code, in <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/contents.html">a
simulator</a>. Ada was a visionary and suggested many ideas for
applications of the Analytical Engine and general-purpose computers beyond
performing arithmetic, such as artificial intelligence and music.
This project might
explore to what extent programs could be written for the Analytical Engine
to explore these applications.
<br/>The contact for this project is
<a href="http://rawl.es/">Simon Rawles</a>.
</dd>
<dt>Computing with construction toys</dt>
<dd>
We will play with Technic Lego or other construction toys in order to 
produce &mdash; with guidance if needed &mdash;
something capable of computation. We may just choose to play with Lego.
We will be playing mathematical games and puzzles in a social area too.
We will bring a few puzzles and games and some Lego,
but please bring along yours too!
<br/>The contacts for this project are
Deepa Shah and Neela Hutton.
</dd>
<dt>Mathematical baking competition</dt>
<dd>
Inspired by the <a href="http://mathsjam.com/conference/index.php?content=cakes">MathsJam baking competition</a>, we invite attendees to bake and bring
a delicious and mathematically interesting cake, ideally with a Lovelace,
Babbage or Analytical Engine theme. The competition will be judged by a
randomly-selected panel.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This list isn't intended to be prescriptive. We'll also be doing anything
that anyone wants to propose on the day or beforehand. Please update us with
your suggestions, and we'll add them here!
